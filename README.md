**Candidate Dashboard** - frontend *(under development)*

Introduction
The entire application is to be based on reversing the standard job search process - employers will be able to browse candidates' offers

Currently, the Angular part only serves to check whether specific functionalities have been implemented correctly
(this is most of the Employer's functionalities), after introducing all the necessary functionalities, the application will be styled appropriately
